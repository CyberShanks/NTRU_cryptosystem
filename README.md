# NTRU Cryptosystem

Uses both KEM (Key Encapsulation Method) and PKE (Public Key Encryption).

Key Generation uses extra long polynomial for added security
```python
extra_secure_poly_generator(d, N, small_modulo)
```
An LLL attack is demonstrated on NTRU cryptosystem, and shows that the cryptosystem is secure against such attacks.
